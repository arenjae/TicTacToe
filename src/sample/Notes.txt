Create class for tic tac toe, separate from controller
create a subclass for ai

2 different ways to approach AI:

1. The first is to make the AI a subclass of tic tac toe, and to control it from there (player moves, ai moves, etc)

	When initializing tic tac toe, an argument is passed to it to specify that it is ai vs player
	NOTE: this probably won't work because for some reason main needs a static class and a static class shouldn't have an instance?

2. The second is to control it separately from the main tic tac toe program. For example, player presses a button, tic tac toe AI presses a button.

Create ai
-For easy, have random number generator randomly select a spot that isn't occupied
-For normal, have random number generator select a corner or the middle, and then a side
-For hard, follow sequence based on where user has moved
    -In ai super class, have a method that checks users moves and attempts to block
    -In ai super class, have a method that checks ai and if there are two ai marks that will make a tic tac toe with a third, then return the position (or modify the global variable for position and return true)



//Basically have a semi sarcastic quirky response to everything
If the computer wins, put revolving statements about robots conquering humanity
if player wins, comment about humanity living for another day
If both
