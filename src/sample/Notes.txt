Create class for tic tac toe, separate from controller
create a subclass for ai

2 different ways to approach AI:

1. The first is to make the AI a subclass of tic tac toe, and to control it from there (player moves, ai moves, etc)

	When initializing tic tac toe, an argument is passed to it to specify that it is ai vs player
	NOTE: this probably won't work because for some reason main needs a static class and a static class shouldn't have an instance?

2. The second is to control it separately from the main tic tac toe program. For example, player presses a button, tic tac toe AI presses a button.
