##Idea
The idea behind this project was to better learn Java, JavaFX, FXML, CSS, Ai, and Neural Networks.
So far, there are these game modes:
  * Player vs Player
  * Player vs CPU

And later when I finish the Neural Network I will add:
  * Player vs Neural Net
  * Neural Net vs CPU


In Progess:
Currently I am working on adding a neural network to play against the player/cpu.
I will be using a library initially, and then once I have a working prototype, I will
write my own neural network.
